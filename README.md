Been taking a Python Deep learning and TKinter course of over the past week so I made a little password manager in C# to change pace.

This password manager will generate passwords with a length of 10 characters. Generated password will always have 2 upper case letters, 2 symbols and 2 numbers + 4 random characters.
The order the password is always randomized before being spit out to the user.  

Features:

1 - Generates passwords

2 - Saves passwords to file (with a name identifier set by the user)

3 - Can get the keys of saved passwords and display them to the user

4 - Allows the user to search for saved passwords. 

All from commandline. I couldn't be bothered to make a GUI for it. I've done enough of that this week :D
